# eShoppy

**eShoppy** is a modern, microservices-based e-commerce application. It provides essential e-commerce functionalities including **Ordering**, **Checkout**, **Catalog**, and **Basket**. This project is built using a wide range of architectural patterns, principles, libraries, and best practices to ensure high scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## Key Features

- **Ordering**: Manage customer orders, including order creation, validation, and processing.
- **Checkout**: Handle payment processing and order finalization.
- **Catalog**: Maintain a comprehensive product catalog with details, categories, and pricing.
- **Basket**: Provide a shopping cart for customers to manage selected products before checkout.

## Technologies and Patterns

eShoppy is built using the following technologies and design patterns:

### **Architectures**

- **Layered Architecture**: Separates the application into layers, each responsible for distinct concerns.
- **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Focuses on handling features end-to-end across all layers for better modularity.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Organizes complex business logic and domains to maintain a clean structure.
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures separation of concerns, enabling the system to be independent of frameworks and UI.

### **Patterns & Principles**

- **SOLID Principles**: Promotes maintainability and scalability through five key design principles.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Facilitates loose coupling between components.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates read and write operations for improved performance and scalability.
- **Mediator, Proxy, Decorator, Options**: Implements various design patterns to handle cross-cutting concerns and component interaction.
- **Pub/Sub, Caching**: Utilizes publisher/subscriber models and caching mechanisms to optimize performance.
- **API Gateway**: Centralizes API management and routing through a single gateway.

### **Databases**

- **Transactional Document DB**: Manages transactions within NoSQL databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store for caching and real-time operations.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based database for local storage.
- **SQL Server**: Robust relational database management system (RDBMS) for handling large-scale data.

### **Containerization and Orchestration**

- **Docker**: Containerizes application components to ensure consistent environments across different stages.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates multi-container applications, enabling easy management of services.

### **API Gateway and Client**

- **YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy)**: Implements an API Gateway for routing and reverse proxying.
- **Refit**: Consumes external APIs via a strongly-typed, RESTful HTTP client.

### **Libraries**

- **Carter**: A minimalistic routing library for creating HTTP APIs.
- **Marten**: Manages event sourcing and data persistence within a PostgreSQL database.
- **MediatR**: Facilitates the implementation of the Mediator pattern for in-process messaging.
- **Mapster**: Maps objects within the application, simplifying data transformations.
- **MassTransit**: Manages message-based communication within distributed systems.
- **FluentValidation**: Implements validation rules within the domain models.
- **EF Core**: Provides ORM capabilities for data access using Entity Framework.
- **Refit**: Simplifies HTTP calls to external services via a REST client.

### **Communications**

- **Sync: gRPC**: Enables synchronous communication between services using high-performance RPC.
- **Async: Publish/Subscribe Pattern**: Implements asynchronous communication using MassTransit and RabbitMQ for message handling.
